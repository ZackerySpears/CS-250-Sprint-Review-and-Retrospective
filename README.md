o	How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?

Understanding user needs typically begins with analyzing the system. This involves seeking feedback from the team and consulting past users about any issues or improvements they would like to see in the code. It's also important to identify both inputs and outputs. User stories play a crucial role in this process, as they allow users to share their desires and requirements. By reviewing these user stories, we can gain valuable insights into the perspective of the end users.

o	How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

There are several approaches to program development. One popular method is the Waterfall Method, which is great for outlining the requirements of a specific strategy. On the other hand, there's Agile, which provides a more adaptable approach, allowing for a distinctive way to handle testing, planning, and client collaboration.

o	What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

I believe that being an effective team member means understanding your responsibilities within the project and ensuring you stay on track. If you don’t, it can slow down the whole team. It’s also important to listen to your teammates and lend a helping hand to those who may require support.
